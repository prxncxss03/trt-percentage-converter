Personally, I like to respond in percentages when it comes to the status of my projects etc. There are also a lot of percentage converters out there. However, when it comes to RT of videos, I haven't seen one or maybe because my search keywords are useless or my app is useless for the majority. But, for me I find it useful coz I transcribe videos that is lengthy and It's much easier for me to visualize in percentages than RT. And computing it manually isn't so much easy. So I had this idea of what if I create a simple app where I can translate my progress in transcription into percentages.

## ðŸ“œUse
RT stands for "Running Time"  
- Convert RT to Percentage
For example, you are watching a 12hr Python Tutorial and you want to know your progress in percentages.
