Personally, I like to respond in percentages when it comes to the status of my projects etc. However, when it comes to transcription, it's hard knowing how much your progress is in percentages because it's quite hard to compute it manually. So I had this idea of what if I create a simple app where I can translate my progress in transcription into percentages.

## ðŸ“œUse
RT stands for "Running Time"  
For example, you are watching a 12hr Python Tutorial. And you want to know your progress in percentages.
